# N-Queens Problem

One of the homeworks for the Artificial Intelligence class I took at UW-Madison the fall of 2020.

The goals for this homework were: 

1. Find the successor states to the current state of the (n) by (n) chess board
2. Implement a heuristic function
3. Implement a hill-climbing algorithm that would optimally find a chess board position in which none of the (n) queens located on the chess board attack each other. 
4. Implement a hill-climbing with random restarts algorithm.
